#📘 Coding Algorithms (Java)
This repository contains Java implementations of popular algorithms, data-structure problems, and number theory methods.  
It is designed for learning, practicing, and quick reference during competitive programming or interview prep.  


#🚀 Features  
Implementations of Mathematical Algorithms (Euclid, Euler, Sieve, Strobogrammatic, etc.)  
Array & String Problems (Majority element, Longest sequence of 1s, Hourglass sum, etc.)  
Bit Manipulation problems (Swap nibbles, Toggle switch, Binary palindrome, etc.)  
Easy-to-understand Java code (beginner-friendly, no extra dependencies)  
Structured into simple .java files for modular practice
