📘 Coding Algorithms (Java)
This repository contains Java implementations of popular algorithms, data-structure problems, and number theory methods.  
It is designed for learning, practicing, and quick reference during competitive programming or interview prep.  


✨ Features  
🎯 Algorithm Implementations: From Euclid’s GCD to strobogrammatic numbers.  
🔢 Array & String Tricks: Palindromes, majority element, longest 1s, more.
🔍 Number Theory: Euler’s Totient, segmented sieve, prime generation.  
🟠 Bit Manipulation: Swap nibbles, toggle switches, all in one place!  
✅ Beginner-Friendly Java: No libraries, just logic.
